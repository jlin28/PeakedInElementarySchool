## Description
- Chess but for people bored of traditional chess! With every move you must answer a random trivia question (which, depending on if you get it right or not, can influence the rest of the match) pulled from a collection of APIs! You can play this either with a friend, through the multiplayer system, or a bot through the singleplayer system! Both gamemodes will be scaled on the chosen difficulty in the menu screen.
