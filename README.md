## Description
- Chess but for people bored of traditional chess! With every move you must answer a random trivia question (which, depending on if you get it right or not, can influence the rest of the match) pulled from a collection of APIs! Additionally, you may be afflicted a random debuff mid match or even receive a buff -- though whether they will be good or bad is debatable.
