INITIAL DD REVIEW
* SUMMARY OF FEEDBACK:
    - Negatives included: explanations of components as well as their relationships not being clear enough,
          component map being convoluted and hard to read,
          static files and helper functions being in the same box -- thus giving the impression that they were one and the same,
          database names being confusing
    - Positives included: nice organization as well as a simple site map,
          compliments on the overall idea and name of the app
* NEW CHANGES:
    - added more detailed explanations to components (primarily html pages)
    - moved unnamed helper functions to be under their respective python files
    - updated component map to be much less convoluted and added little explanations regarding the relationship
      each arrow represents
    - slight changes to database variable naming for clarity
    - imported updated design doc to repo
    - set up readme
